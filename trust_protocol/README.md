# The Trust Protocol: Human APIs for High-Performing Teams

## Abstract
Modern teams work in environments defined by constant change: new hires, shifting priorities, distributed work, and continuous delivery pressure. In this reality, trust is often assumed—or ignored—until it becomes a problem.

Let's reframe trust as something concrete and intentional rather than “soft” or accidental. By looking at how teams actually form, break down, and recover, we explore why trust is a critical enabler of psychological safety, healthy conflict, accountability, and sustained delivery.

Based on real-world experience building and joining product teams in an enterprise setting, let's connect research-backed insights with practical observations from day-to-day team life. Attendees will leave with a clearer mental model for understanding trust in teams and new ways to think about onboarding, collaboration, and team dynamics in Agile environments.

Because tooling scales systems, but trust scales teams.
